<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


We want to help accelerate response time to fall-related incidents by creating software that can determine 
falls in real-time. We hope to achieve accurate and speedy detections to help prevent dangerous falls from 
turning into life-threatening altercations as the victims are rendered unable to call for help.



### Built With

* [Open CV](https://opencv.org/)
* [Psycopg2](https://www.psycopg.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Imutils ](https://github.com/jrosebr1/imutils)
* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
